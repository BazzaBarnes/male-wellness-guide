                <strong>üßº Essential Prep:</strong><br>
                ‚Ä¢ Take a warm shower to relax and get clean<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Use the bathroom beforehand<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Get your high-quality water-based lube ready<br>

        <!-- Step 3: Understanding Your Anatomy -->
        <div class="step" id="step3">
            <h2>üéØ Finding Your Target</h2>
            <p>Your prostate is a walnut-sized gland about 2-3 inches inside your ass, toward your belly. When stimulated properly, it creates sensations unlike anything else.</p>
            
            <div class="tips">
                <strong>üîç What to Look For:</strong><br>
                ‚Ä¢ It feels slightly firmer and more textured than the smooth walls around it<br>
                ‚Ä¢ When you find it, you'll feel a different sensation - maybe like you need to pee<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Don't worry if it feels weird at first - that's totally normal<br>
                ‚Ä¢ The right pressure creates deep, warm sensations that spread outward
            </div>
            
            <p>Think of your prostate as your body's secret pleasure center. Most guys never discover it, but once you do, you'll understand what you've been missing.</p>

        <!-- Step 4: First Contact -->
        <div class="step" id="step4">
            <h2>ü§è Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Start by getting yourself relaxed and aroused. Maybe touch yourself normally to get your body responding, then begin external massage around your asshole.</p>
            
            <div class="tips">
                <strong>üëÜ Finger Technique:</strong><br>
                ‚Ä¢ Use LOTS of lube - way more than you think you need<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Start with gentle circles around the outside<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Slowly insert one well-lubed finger<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Let your body adjust - no rushing!<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Explore gently until you find that firmer spot
            </div>
            
            <p>Once you find your prostate with your finger, try gentle pressure and massage. This "warms up" your prostate before using your toy.</p>

            <div class="tips">
                <strong>üõ†Ô∏è Insertion Technique:</strong><br>

                ‚Ä¢ Add more lube to yourself too<br>
                ‚Ä¢ Insert slowly, letting your body stretch and accommodate<br>
                ‚Ä¢ The curved part should press against your prostate<br>
                ‚Ä¢ The base should sit comfortably between your ass cheeks
            </div>
            
            <p>Once it's in position, you should feel constant, gentle pressure against your prostate. Don't move it yet - just get used to the sensation.</p>
            
            <div class="sensation-tracker">

                ‚Ä¢ This pushes the toy more firmly against your prostate<br>

                <strong>Q: Does this make me gay?</strong><br>
                A: Absolutely not! This is about anatomy and nerve endings. Straight guys have the same prostate and capacity for pleasure. Sexual orientation is about who you're attracted to, not what feels good to your body.
            </div>
            
            <div class="tips">
                <strong>Q: What if I can't achieve orgasm?</strong><br>
                A: Totally normal! Some guys need multiple sessions to build that mind-body connection. The key is patience and not putting pressure on yourself. Even just feeling good sensations is progress!
            </div>
            
            <div class="tips">
                <strong>Q: How often is safe?</strong><br>
                A: Weekly is probably fine for health benefits, but every 2 weeks to monthly preserves sensitivity better. Listen to your body and adjust based on how intense each session remains.
            </div>
            
            <div class="tips">
                <strong>Q: Will I lose sensitivity from my dick?</strong><br>
                A: Nope! These are different pleasure pathways. Many guys find prostate play actually improves their regular sexual function.
